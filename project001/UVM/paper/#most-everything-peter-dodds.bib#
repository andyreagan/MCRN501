                  provides a framework for viewing the probability of
                  the occurrence of earthquakes in a given region and
                  for a given cutoff magnitude. The law shows that
                  earthquakes occur in hierarchical correlated
                  clusters, which overlap with other spatially
                  separated correlated clusters for large enough time
                  periods and areas. For a small enough region and
                  time-scale, only a single correlated group can be
                  sampled. The law links together the
                  Gutenberg–Richter Law, the Omori Law of aftershocks,
                  and the fractal dimensions of the faults. The Omori
                  Law is shown to be the short time limit of general
                  hierarchical phenomenon containing the statistics of
                  both “main shocks” and “aftershocks,” indicating
                  that they are created by the same mechanism.},

  abstract =	 {Durkheim argued that improvements in transportation
                  or further increases in the density of a population
                  would lead to increased division of labor and to the
                  effacement of segmental (territorial) types of
                  organization. This paper develops the thesis that
                  segmental growth-an increase in the number of
                  segmental units-is the result of expansion of the
                  settlement area under constant conditions of
                  transportation. Two recent models of geopolitical
                  structure, developed by Boulding and Stinchcombe,
                  are shown to be related to this thesis and are made
                  the basis for a formal representation of it. The
                  thesis is then used to explain a particular case of
                  segmental growth-the historical process of dividing
                  states into county jurisdictions. Existing variation
                  in county size is explained by the termination of
                  segmental growth following the introduction of the
                  automobile.},
