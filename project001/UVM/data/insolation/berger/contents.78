Format for the BEIN files, each containing 100 kyr of data:

Line 1:          Age in Kyears (0=1950 A.D.),  Eccentricity, Longitude of
                 Perihelion, Obliquity, Precession.

Lines 2 to 20:   Age, Latitude, Mid-month insolations for January to December.


                 - Age is in thousands of years, negative in the past.  
                 - Latitude is in degrees, positive in the northern hemisphere.
                 - Insolations are in langleys/day (cal/cm2/day). Multiply
                   by .4843 to convert to Watts/m2
                 - Solar constant taken as 1.95 cal/cm2/min for 1978 solution,
                   and 1360 W/m2 for the 1991 solution.
                 - For other definitions, see papers listed in file CITATION.
