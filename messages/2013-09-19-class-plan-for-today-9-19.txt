Hi all,

We will start with the presentation by the ASU team.  I am slightly amending the order from that given in the syllabus after that. Today, I will cover the basic equations of Geophysical Fluid Dynamics. Notes are loaded up in sakai. Look at GFD_ss.PDF under resources --> notes

Best, Chris.
