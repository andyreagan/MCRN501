Hi all,

You should have received an email saying there is an announcement of the reading and guiding questions for Tuesday's class.

I have also got the video recordings all ready. If you search for "mcrn501" on youtube, you should find 5 videos available. Please watch these before Tuesday's class. They are posted on the youtube channel MCRN-UNC Climod. Below are the direct links in case of any issues.

Tuesday's class will proceed as follows:

2-2:15 Brief discussion of dynamical systems background material and poll-quiz to test understanding and isolate any issues. You will need to have watched the videos to answer the questions (i.e., it will take more than just being smart!)

2:15-2:35 Break-out group discussions around questions given in announcement. Somebody in each group shoudl take notes to post on the sakai site.

2:35-2:45 Reconvene and share highlights of discussions.

2:45-3:05 Break-out group exercise on the Stommel model.

3:05-3:15 Groups report back.

Best, Chris.

PS REMINDER FOR UNC STUDENTS: PH301 on Tuesday!
