Hi all,

I have posted a schedule for tomorrow's class as an announcement. Each group will have 5 minutes and there will be 2 minutes for switchovers. Please keep to your time!!

You will need to have your presentation set up on a computer and be able to use audio with it. If you have a webcam, that would be nice also so the rest of us can see you!

 

Looking forward to it! best, Chris J.
