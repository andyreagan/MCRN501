Hi all,

I am attaching three problems I would like you to do before class tomorrow. They are not difficult, but it would really help if you had gotten these loaded in your mind before class! We will have poll/quiz on them. Also, make sure you have read the other notes I uploaded on CDV and the videos on PV conservation, streamfunctions and the BV model.

See you all tomorrow. Best, Chris.
