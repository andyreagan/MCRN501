Hi all,

Tuesday's class will be based on the two papers:

Saltzman 1962
Lorenz 1963

in the resources --> papers section. Please read them!! Attached and below (as well as in the announcements section) is a set of guiding questions for you to ponder.
Tuesday's class will proceed as follows:

2:00-2:30 discussion of mathematical content of the two papers, with poll/quiz to prompt discussion and check comprehension of issues.
2:30-2:50 group discussions of guiding questions
2:50-3:15 groups reporting on discussions.

Guideline questions for the Lorenz and Saltzman papers:

Compare and contrast the different goals of Saltzman and Lorenz.
Discuss experimental implementations of Lorenz’ work (for the Vermont group!)
Lorenz “proves” that non-periodic motion can occur in a simple system.
The equations should be called the Saltzman equations as he derived them first. Discuss.
Lorenz’ work is so important because he showed there is a strange attractor in a simple system.
Lorenz’ work has had so much influence in the climate community because it showed the limits to predictability.
The phenomena exposed in a low-dimensional model should not be viewed as physically relevant unless we know they are reproduced in the (full) model being approximated.
If an approximation obtained by cutting off all but a small number of modes cannot be justified mathematically then it should not be trusted to give physically realistic results.
Just because chaotic motion occurs in a low-dimensional model like the Lorenz system, there is no reason to believe it will be ubiquitous in high-dimensional systems.
