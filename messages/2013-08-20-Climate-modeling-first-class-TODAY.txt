you will be asked your name, enter it and then just enter the room. You may be asked to give some permissions to adobe and/or to download an add-in. This should happen very quickly. If you have any issues, email Andrew Roberts:

arob@live.unc.edu

At today's class, I will explain the structure of the course, expectations, grading etc.

See you later! best, Chris J.
