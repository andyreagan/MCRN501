Hi all,

Sorry for the delay in getting the background video up. I will have it available later today. It will be about finding fixed points of a dynamical system and their stability/attraction properties.

I have uploaded some notes I wrote this morning on deriving the Stommel model in detail. This is not done fully in the book and I will only sketch the steps in class tomorrow.

Yesterday's lecture is now available. Both Lectures and notes will be posted on the sakai site under "Resources"

Best, Chris.
