Hi all,

The videos of the background DS material are now up on the you tube channel. Find them by searching for MATH768 or MCRN501.

I have also uploaded various files under resources: (1) a set of book references, (2) ppt and/or smart-board notes from past lectures, (3) some more papers, and (4) some notes I wrote on proving that if all eigenvalues of the Jacobian at a fixed point are in the left half plane then the fixed point is attracting.

All of the lectures are now available as recordings on adobe connect (thanks, Andrew, for posting them so promptly.) Access them by going to resources and looking under "Class lectures."

Best, Chris.
